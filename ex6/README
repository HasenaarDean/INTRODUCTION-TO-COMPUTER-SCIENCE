I discussed the exercise with: No one.

==================
=  Description:  =
==================

1.) This function calculates the distance between 2 different pixels. 

2.) This function calculates the distance between 2 different images. 

3.) This function returns a piece from an image by getting an input
    image, tuple of pixel location and tuple size of piece. 

4.) This function changes a certain piece in the image with pixels from
    another picture, by getting an input image, tuple of pixel location
    and the second image which exchange the piece of the original image. 

5.) This function returns the averaged color of the pixels in the image.
    the function gets an input image as list of lists and returns a tuple
    contains 3 values: average of red, green and blue. 

6.) This function returns a list of the tiles with the averaged colors
    for each tile. 

7.) This function returns a list of the tiles which their averaged
    color pixel is more similar to the averaged color pixel of the target
    image. 

8.) This function gets an input list of averages and calculates the
    index of the best average which is closest to the input averaged color
    of an image.
    this function helps us to implement the function: get_best_tiles. 

9.) This function chooses the best tile from a list of tiles. 

10.) This function creates a photomosaic image by using the algorithm. the
    function gets an input image, an input list of tiles and an input int
    number of the tiles in the list which the best tile was chosen from. 

11.) This function runs the program and saves the solution in a file.
