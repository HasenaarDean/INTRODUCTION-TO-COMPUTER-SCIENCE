I discussed the exercise with: no one.

==================
=  Description:  =
==================

 
In this exercised we created the Hangman game. 
we used 5 functions in file hangman.py:


1.) This function gets as inputs word, current pattern and a letter and
     returns an updated pattern which includes the same letter. 

2.) This function gets the words list and implements the hangman game
    itself.

3.) This function does not get and does not return any values, but
     implements three operations: 1. loads words.txt file into a list by
     using the load_words function. 2. runs the game by using the
     run_single_game function. 3. at the end of each game asks the user if
     he wants to play again, by using the function get_input.

4.) This function gets as an input the words list, the current pattern and
    the list of wrong guesses and returns a new list which includes only the
    words from the input list which may fit the previous pattern and
    guesses.

5.) This function gets an input words list (which is fitting to the current
    pattern) and also gets the current pattern, and returns the most frequent
    letter in the list.

Answers for questions:



1. If all the words in the words list were in Hebrew, then I would have to change 

my program in this way: 


I would change the function run_single_game() like this: 

In order to check whether or not a character is a valid letter, I would create a 

constant set of strings of all the Hebrew letters and would check whether or not 

the character belongs to the set, instead of using the function islower().
